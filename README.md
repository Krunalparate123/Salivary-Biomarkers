A Bioinformatics Approach for Identical Salivary Biomarker Discovery

📌 Project Overview
This repository contains my research work on salivary biomarkers for disease diagnosis and monitoring.  
The study focuses on RNA-Seq based biomarker discovery using the Galaxy platform, integrating computational workflows for cancer, chronic disease, and healthy control saliva samples.  

🧪 Tools & Methods Used
- Data Source: NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRP493350)  
- Galaxy Platform: For RNA-Seq analysis  
- FastQC → Quality control of sequencing reads  
- Trimmomatic → Adapter trimming and filtering  
- Bowtie2 → Alignment with human reference genome (hg38)  
- **FeatureCounts** → Gene expression quantification  
- **Differential Expression & Functional Analysis**
